### Hi, I'm Efra ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software development enthusiast who loves technology built to improve and simplify the user experience.

I enjoy collaborate on developing systems from scratch using all possible shoes.
Most of the time I belong to the front-end engineering team but I have to admit that I lean towards back-end engineering.

I enjoy working on complex architecture systems with technologies like Docker, NodeJS, GraphQL, AWS, gRPC, RN, and NextJS.
