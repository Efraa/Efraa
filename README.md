### Hi, I'm Efra ðŸ‘‹

I am Efra, a passionate software engineer with 6+ years of experience who loves technology created to enhance and simplify people's daily lives. As an engineer, I have been able to acquire knowledge in many areas related to software development, such as requirement specification, design, architecture, coding, and implementation. I have a proven history with a wide range of delivered and in-production products.

I derive immense satisfaction from spearheading the creation and advancement of systems, leveraging a toolkit comprising TypeScript, Docker, Node, React, React Native, gRPC, and GraphQL. A staunch proponent of open-source ideals, I am committed to advocating for collaborative and accessible software solutions.
